A much more sophisticated project. A social network for creating public and private stories. 

This app uses a Google OAuth 2.0 strategy for authentication. Users can login and create stories which can be set to public or private. They can also choose if comments are allowed to be posted. We will create a dashboard for users to manage their stories. We will create helpers for authentication and access control as well as handlebars template helpers. We will prepare and deploy this app to Heroku and add a domain name
